rePresent
=========

*Create your presentation slides with your favourite tool [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org)*

rePresent started out as a revamped version of the [JessyInk](http://code.google.com/p/jessyink/) script for inkscape.

Most of the javascript code is moved to a dedicated export filter written in python wich does all the neccesry SVG setup. Only the presentation logic is left to the javascript code wich runs in the webbrowser.

For now there are no transition effects (and problaby never will be).
